This runbook describes how to connect a Windows laptop to the corporate Wi-Fi network CORP-WIFI.

## Prerequisites

- A valid corporate account (username and password).
- Wireless adapter enabled on the laptop.
- Physical presence in the office where CORP-WIFI is available.

## Steps

1. Click the Wi-Fi icon in the taskbar.
2. Make sure Wi-Fi is turned on.
3. In the list of available networks, select **CORP-WIFI**.
4. Click **Connect**.
5. When prompted for credentials:
   - Enter your username in the format **DOMAIN\username**.
   - Enter your corporate password.
6. If a security certificate warning appears, verify that the network name is correct and click **Connect** or **Accept**.
7. Wait until the status changes to **Connected, secured**.

## Troubleshooting

- If the network is not visible:
  - Move closer to an access point.
  - Make sure Wi-Fi is not disabled by a hardware switch.
- If authentication fails:
  - Check that Caps Lock is not enabled.
  - Try logging into another corporate service to verify your credentials.
  - If you still cannot log in, contact IT Support to check if your account is locked.
